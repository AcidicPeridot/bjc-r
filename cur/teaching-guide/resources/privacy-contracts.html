		<title>Student Accounts and Privacy</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		
		<div class="todo">Start with some nice way to say "we can't sign any contracts" but then also "your students dont need any accounts. Also have some stuff about teacher accounts (with students) and space for what happens with student accounts in June. As well as - at a glance - you don't need student accounts."
		<p>Jane's remaining questions: not sure how teacher accounts work...</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>BJC and Student Privacy</h2>
		<p>Many school districts ask suppliers of computing services to sign privacy agreements making certain guarantees about how student Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected, stored, and used. We, the developers of the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) curricula (both <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/" title="BJC CSP" target="_blank">BJC CSP</a> for high school Advanced Placement courses and <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/sparks" title="BJC Sparks" target="_blank">BJC Sparks</a> for middle school and early high school), are committed to privacy&mdash;for students, teachers, and everyone. However, as a relatively small, grant-funded project, <strong> BJC does not have the capacity to sign privacy agreements for schools</strong>. Fortunately, students can use BJC curriculua and the Snap<em>!</em> programming language used in BJC without sharing any student PII.</p>
		
		<p>
			It helps to understand that there are three different free services involved:
			<ol>
				<li>The <strong>BJC curriculum</strong> (either BJC CSP or BJC Sparks), which does not collect any student information</li>
				<div class="sidenote">See the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/privacy" title="Snap! Privacy Policy" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> privacy policy</a> for additional details.</div>
				<li>The <strong>Snap<em>!</em> programming language</strong> used by BJC, which can be used without sharing any PII (that is, without creating user accounts) by saving Snap<em>!</em> project files locally</li>
				<li>The <strong>Snap<em>!</em> Cloud</strong>, an extra service within Snap<em>!</em> that allows users to create an account for saving Snap<em>!</em> projects in the cloud by collecting one piece of PII: an email address used for password reset requests, which can be a teacher's or other staff person's email address</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	
		
		<p>
			There are several ways for students to store their Snap<em>!</em> projects. Teachers should work with their school admistrators and/or IT support to determine which of the following approaches is right for your context, and students should be instructed in the selected approach using the curriculum page provided in the first lab of the first unit of the BJC course being used:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Creating student Snap<em>!</em> accounts <em>without using</em> student PII:</strong> (<em>best option for most schools</em>) teachers or IT staff set up student accounts in bulk and use a teacher or school email address for all of them </li>
				<li><strong>Creating student Snap<em>!</em> accounts <em>using</em> student PII:</strong> (best option for student control of their own accounts) students age 13 or over (per <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa" title="Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA)" target="_blank">Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, COPPA</a>) use their own email address to create Snap<em>!</em> accounts</li>
				<li><strong>Using Snap<em>!</em> without accounts by saving projects locally:</strong> (best option for adherence to strict legal policies) students download their Snap<em>!</em> projects and save them to their computer, to a school network, or to a school-approved third-party storage provider such as Dropbox or Google Drive; this is safest pratice for maintaining legal compliance since there is no data transfer to any new systems, though it is less convenient than saving and opening  Snap<em>!</em> files directly through the Snap<em>!</em> interface</li>
				<li><strong>Setting up your own Snap<em>!</em> server:</strong> (advanced option for even stricter policies; requires advanced support) teachers or IT staff host and update their own copy of the Snap<em>!</em> repository and manage student accounts on a server already trusted by the school (this is  advanced option requires hosting and troubleshooting your own cloud service)</li>
			</ol>

		<h3>Creating Student Snap<em>!</em> Accounts <em>Without Using</em> Student PII</h3>
		<p>If your users use the Snap<em>!</em> cloud to store their Snap<em>!</em> projects, we collect one piece of information that might be considered PII: an email address used for password reset requests. The <em>best practice</em> for schools that want to use the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud is to set up class accounts in bulk (separate from any personal Snap<em>!</em> account a student might have) and to <em>use a teacher's (or other staff member's) email address</em> for all of them.</p>
		<p>To do this, log in to the teacher's or staff member's Snap<em>!</em> account, go to <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/teacher" title="snap.berkeley.edu/teacher" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu/teacher</a>, and follow the instructions for bulk account creation. Snap<em>!</em> user names and passwords are then provided to students and can only be changed by the teaher account.</p>

			<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/save-dialog.png" alt="Save to computer option" title="Save to computer option"/>
			You can use Snap<em>!</em> without sending Snap<em>!</em> (or BJC) any PII. To use Snap<em>!</em> in this way, users connect to the Snap<em>!</em> website as usual: <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/run" title="Snap" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu/run</a>. When they want to save a project, they go to the File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), choose "Save" and select “Computer” from the save dialog (shown right). The project will be saved in the browser’s download folder as an XML file. For class assignments, students submit their projects as XML files via a achool-approved transmission method. Teachers can open an XML file in Snap<em>!</em> by dragging the file into the Snap<em>!</em> window or by selecting "Open..." from the Snap<em>!</em> file menu and locating the file on the local computer. 
		</p>
		<p>(Please note that we do log IP addresses of site users so that we can mitigate site abuse, and so we could possibly determine that <em>someone</em> at your school has used Snap<em>!</em>, though we wouldn’t know who. IP addresses alone are not generally considered PII. If this is a concern for your school, the best option is to set up your own  Snap<em>!</em> server.)</p>
	
		




		<h3>Using Snap<em>!</em> Cloud without providing student PII</h3>
		<p>Even if you use the Snap<em>!</em> cloud to store your projects, we collect only one piece of what <em>might</em> be considered PII: an email address to be used for password reset requests. The <em>best practice</em> for schools that want to use the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud is to set up class accounts in bulk, separate from any personal Snap<em>!</em> account a student might have, and <em>use the teacher’s email address</em> for all of them. Then we unambiguously collect no student PII.</p>
		<div class="narrower">
			<p>Apart from the question of PII, there are other practical reasons for using the teacher’s address: It allows the teacher to handle lost passwords on the spot, without having to work out which email a student might have used. And it means the accounts are ready to go on the first day of class, without wasting that day getting everyone set up.</p>
			<p>To set up accounts, use the cloud button (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" alt="cloud menu button" title="cloud menu button" />).</p>
			<p>“Collect” means that <em>we ask for</em> a piece of information. Students might <em>choose</em> to put personal information <em>in a project</em>. We can’t police that.</p>
			<p>It’s important not to undo the anonymity of your student accounts by, for example, using the school’s student ID number as the Snap<em>!</em> username. Student ID numbers are definitely considered PII; we don’t want to know them.</p>
			<p>Have a plan for what happens after students leave your class or you lose access to your email account. At the end of the school year, consider having students download their projects as XML files.</p>
			<p>Our lawyer thinks that a student email address <em>by itself</em> is not PII. But we prefer a solution that doesn’t depend on your lawyer having the same opinion as ours. We need an email address; if it isn’t the student’s, that simplifies everyone’s life.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Server</h3>
		<p>If even that bothers your lawyers, you can set up your own Snap<em>!</em> server by downloading our <a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases/latest" title="GitHub repository" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. If you do this, your IT person should check regularly for updates, which are announced on our forum, on the BJC Teachers forum on Piazza, and on the TEALS forum.</p>
	
		<h3>Additional considerations regarding PII</h3>
		<p>
	<ul>		
				<li>
					<strong>We have no control over what unsolicited information you or your students send us.</strong> This means that we might <em>possess</em> PII that we don’t <em>collect</em>, without knowing we have it, so we can’t promise that there is no PII stored in our cloud storage. For example, if a child makes a Snap<em>!</em> project that says “I’m 15 years old today” that’s a piece of PII that is in our cloud, but we don’t <em>know</em> we have it. We can’t teach your students to protect their privacy. We do encourage them to be careful, in our official privacy policy, but children are children. Similarly, we have no control over choices <em>you</em>, as a teacher or administrator, make. If you create accounts for your students that use your student ID numbers as the usernames, you are giving us PII that <em>we do not want</em> and can’t control. Usernames, in particular, are visible to anyone who uses our community web site.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Our users want to share information with each other.</strong> This is another reason why you should set up the accounts for class use yourself, separate from students’ personal accounts. We have a <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu" title="Snap! Community Website" target="_blank">community web site</a>, where users can publish their programming projects and comment on each others’ work. They learn from each other and from us (we participate on the <a href="https://forum.snap.berkeley.edu" title="Snap! Community Forum" target="_blank">community forum</a>). We may also aggregate information from <em>published</em> projects for research purposes. So if you do choose to use our cloud storage, you should disallow publication of projects from class accounts. You are then not responsible for what someone who happens to be your student does outside of school on their separate personal account.
				</li>
	</ul>
		</p>
	
		<h3>Can't you just sign our contract?</h3>
		<p>Sorry, no, we can't sign a contract with you. There are three reasons:
	<ul>
						<li><em>Legally, there is no contract without mutual consideration.</em> That means we promise to do something for you, and you promise to do something for us. (In a typical commercial contract, the latter would be your promise to pay the company money.) But with Snap<em>!</em>, you aren’t doing anything for us. We don’t charge money. We don’t benefit in any way from your use of Snap<em>!</em> other than feeling proud of our work.</li>
						<li><em>We are not authorized to sign contracts</em> on behalf of the University of California, Berkeley, which is the organization that sponsors our work. And the University’s lawyers would never agree to a contract that exposes the University to substantial risk (if, say, someone breaks into our computer and steals our users’ email addresses and you sue us) for no benefit.</li>
						<li><em>Those boilerplate contracts typically require us to provide services</em> that we are not equipped to provide, such as audits, daily backups, and/or interfacing with your classroom management system. We are half a dozen developers, with no IT staff and zero budget. <em>Commercial</em> providers of computing services to schools factor the cost of services like these into the fees they charge you.</li>
	</ul>
		If you follow one of the best practices recommended above, you don’t need a contract with us, because we collect no student PII.</p>
