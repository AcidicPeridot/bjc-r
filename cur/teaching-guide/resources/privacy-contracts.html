		<title>Student Accounts and Privacy</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		
		<div class="todo">Start with some nice way to say "we can't sign any contracts" but then also "your students dont need any accounts. Also have some stuff about teacher accounts (with students) and space for what happens with student accounts in June. As well as - at a glance - you don't need student accounts."
		<p>Jane's remaining questions: not sure how teacher accounts work...</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Many school districts ask ask suppliers of computing services to sign privacy agreements making certain guarantees about how student Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected, stored, and used. We are very committed to privacy, especially for children. Unfortunately, we cannot sign your privacy agreement. But the good news is you can use BJC and Snap<em>!</em> without sending us any PII as long as you do not use Snap<em>!</em> Cloud.</p>
		
		<p>To be clear, there are three different services:
		<ol>
			<li>The <strong>BJC curriculum</strong> is freely available and does not collect any student information so there is no issue with privacy.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Snap<em>!</em> programming language</strong> is also freely available. It is possible to run and use Snap<em>!</em> without ever making an account or sending any student information. In this case, projects would be saved locally. Learn how this works below.</li>
			<li>Within Snap<em>!</em> is an extra service, <strong>Snap<em>!</em> Cloud</strong>. This is also free. Students can make an account and save their projects to the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud. In this case, there is one piece of PII collected, an email address to be used for password reset requests. But even this does not have to be student PII. Learn more below.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
	
		<p>See also the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/privacy" title="Snap! Privacy Policy" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> privacy policy</a>.</p>
	
	
	
		<h2>Using Snap<em>!</em> without student accounts</h2>
		<p>You can use Snap<em>!</em> without sending us any information, PII or otherwise. We don’t have to know you exist. To use Snap<em>!</em> in this way, you save programming projects on your own computer or a third-party storage provider such as Dropbox or Google Drive, rather than in our cloud storage. This is the <em>best practice</em> for maintaining legal compliance; we recommend it to schools.</p>
					<div class="narrower">
						<p>To use Snap<em>!</em> in this way, you connect to our web site as usual: snap.berkeley.edu/run. This will download Snap<em>!</em> to your browser, and you have no further need to interact with us in that session.</p>
						<p>We do log IP addresses of clients, so we could possibly determine that someone at your school has used Snap<em>!</em>. But we wouldn’t know who; IP addresses alone are not generally considered PII. If even that bothers your lawyers, you can set up your own Snap<em>!</em> server by downloading our <a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases/latest" title="GitHub repository" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. If you do this, your IT person should check regularly for updates, which are announced on our forum, on the BJC Teachers forum on Piazza, and on the TEALS forum.</p>
						<p>
							Once you have Snap<em>!</em> running in your browser, when you want to save a project, go to the File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), choose "Save" and select “Computer” from the save dialog:<br />
							<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/computer_save_option.png" alt="Save to computer option" title="Save to computer option"/><br />
							The project will be saved in the browser’s download location as an XML file.
						</p>
						<p>For class assignments, students would submit their projects as XML files. You can open an XML file in several ways, including dragging the file into Snap<em>!</em> </p>
					</div>
	
		<h2>Using Snap<em>!</em> Cloud without providing student PII</h2>
		<p>Even if you use the Snap<em>!</em> cloud to store your projects, we collect only one piece of what might be considered PII: an email address to be used for password reset requests. The <em>best practice</em> for schools that want to use the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud is to set up class accounts in bulk, separate from any personal Snap<em>!</em> account a student might have, and <em>use the teacher’s email address</em> for all of them. Then we unambiguously collect no student PII.</p>
					<div class="narrower">
						<p>Apart from the question of PII, there are other practical reasons for using the teacher’s address: It allows the teacher to handle lost passwords on the spot, without having to work out which email a student might have used. And it means the accounts are ready to go on the first day of class, without wasting that day getting everyone set up.</p>
						<p>To set up accounts, use the cloud button (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" alt="cloud menu button" title="cloud menu button" />).</p>
						<p>“Collect” means that <em>we ask for</em> a piece of information. Students might <em>choose</em> to put personal information <em>in a project</em>. We can’t police that.</p>
						<p>It’s important not to undo the anonymity of your student accounts by, for example, using the school’s student ID number as the Snap<em>!</em> username. Student ID numbers are definitely considered PII; we don’t want to know them.</p>
						<p>Have a plan for what happens after students leave your class or you lose access to your email account. At the end of the school year, consider having students download their projects as XML files.</p>
						<p>Our lawyer thinks that a student email address <em>by itself</em> is not PII. But we prefer a solution that doesn’t depend on your lawyer having the same opinion as ours. We need an email address; if it isn’t the student’s, that simplifies everyone’s life.</p>
					</div>
	
		<h2>Additional considerations regarding PII</h2>
			<ul>		
				<li>
					<strong>We have no control over what unsolicited information you or your students send us.</strong> This means that we might <em>possess</em> PII that we don’t <em>collect</em>, without knowing we have it, so we can’t promise that there is no PII stored in our cloud storage. For example, if a child makes a Snap<em>!</em> project that says “I’m 15 years old today” that’s a piece of PII that is in our cloud, but we don’t <em>know</em> we have it. We can’t teach your students to protect their privacy. We do encourage them to be careful, in our official privacy policy, but children are children. Similarly, we have no control over choices <em>you</em>, as a teacher or administrator, make. If you create accounts for your students that use your student ID numbers as the usernames, you are giving us PII that <em>we do not want</em> and can’t control. Usernames, in particular, are visible to anyone who uses our community web site.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Our users want to share information with each other.</strong> This is another reason why you should set up the accounts for class use yourself, separate from students’ personal accounts. We have a <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu" title="Snap! Community Website" target="_blank">community web site</a>, where users can publish their programming projects and comment on each others’ work. They learn from each other and from us (we participate on the <a href="https://forum.snap.berkeley.edu" title="Snap! Community Forum" target="_blank">community forum</a>). We may also aggregate information from <em>published</em> projects for research purposes. So if you do choose to use our cloud storage, you should disallow publication of projects from class accounts. You are then not responsible for what someone who happens to be your student does outside of school on their separate personal account.
				</li>
			</ul>
	
	
		<h2>Can't you just sign our contract?</h2>
		<p>Sorry, no, we can't sign a contract with you. There are three reasons:
					<ul>
						<li><em>Legally, there is no contract without mutual consideration.</em> That means we promise to do something for you, and you promise to do something for us. (In a typical commercial contract, the latter would be your promise to pay the company money.) But with Snap<em>!</em>, you aren’t doing anything for us. We don’t charge money. We don’t benefit in any way from your use of Snap<em>!</em> other than feeling proud of our work.</li>
						<li><em>We are not authorized to sign contracts</em> on behalf of the University of California, Berkeley, which is the organization that sponsors our work. And the University’s lawyers would never agree to a contract that exposes the University to substantial risk (if, say, someone breaks into our computer and steals our users’ email addresses and you sue us) for no benefit.</li>
						<li><em>Those boilerplate contracts typically require us to provide services</em> that we are not equipped to provide, such as audits, daily backups, and/or interfacing with your classroom management system. We are half a dozen developers, with no IT staff and zero budget. <em>Commercial</em> providers of computing services to schools factor the cost of services like these into the fees they charge you.</li>
					</ul>
		If you follow one of the best practices recommended above, you don’t need a contract with us, because we collect no student PII.</p>
