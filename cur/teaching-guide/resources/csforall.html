		<p><a href="https://bjc.edc.org/" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Computer Science Principles" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Computer Science Principles</a> (BJC CSP) is an introductory computer science course developed by the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC). BJC CSP uses the free visual programming language, <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" title="Snap! programming language" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em></a>, to offer access to rigorous programming concepts without the overhead of syntax required by a text-based language. Both BJC CSP and Snap<em>!</em> are available online for free.</p>
		<p>BJC is recognized by the College Board as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for Advanced Placement® Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). Through a sequence of 8 units, the year-long course covers the 6 AP CSP Computational Thinking Practices and 5 Big Ideas with extra attention to programming including higher order functions and (in later units) recursion.</p>
		<p>BJC CSP has been developed with funding from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education and is designed for use in high school in an AP or non-AP context and offered as CS10 at UC Berkeley. </p>

		<p><a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Sparks" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Sparks</a> (BJC Sparks) is also an introductory computer science curriculum developed by UC Berkeley and EDC that uses Snap<em>!</em>. Both BJC CSP and Snap<em>!</em> are available online for free.</p>
		<p>BJC Sparks addresses the CSTA standards for middle school through 3 units that each cover a different programming style: Unit 1: Functions and Data covers the basics of functional programming through activities on string manipulation, data processing, and image manipulation. Unit 2: Sequencing and Iteration introduces imperative and event-based programming through sound and music, animation, smart systems, and data transmission. Unit 3: Physical Computing teaches physical computing using the BBC micro:bit.</p>
		<p>BJC Sparks is being developed with funding from the Hopper-Dean Foundation, is designed for use in middle school or early high school, and can serve as a complementary introduction to the BJC CSP course.</p>

		<p><a href="https://elementarymath.edc.org/k-5/" title="Think Math!" target="_blank">Think Math!</a> is a curriculum for grades K–5 that fosters children’s natural curiosity and helps them develop strong mathematical habits of mind through puzzles, investigations, and games that provide opportunities for surprise, pattern finding, and mathematical thinking.</p>
		<p><a href="https://elementarymath.edc.org/programming/" title="Math+C" target="_blank">Math+C</a> is a collection of opportunities for children to explore key mathematical content through the block-based programming language Snap!. Lessons are organized in mini-units aligned to grade-level standards, in which students build and debug their own scripts in order to solve a series of engaging mathematical puzzles.</p>
		<p>Think Math! and Math+C have been developed by EDC with funding from the National Science Foundation, and all content is available online for free.</p>
		
		<h3>Research-Practice Partnership</h3>
		<p>The Education Development Center (EDC) and the New York City (NYC) Department of Education (NYCDOE) propose a research-practice partnership (RPP) to enhance and study the implementation of Advanced Placement(R) Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) courses in low-performing NYC high schools. This partnership will build on the prior Beauty and Joy of Computing in New York City project, a partnership in which EDC and the University of California Berkeley created, tested, and refined the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) high school AP CSP course. In that project, NYCDOE partnered with EDC and UCB to recruit and train more than 100 BJC teachers from a demographically representative set of NYC high schools. This new project focuses more intentionally on assisting low-performing NYC schools in implementing and sustaining engaging AP CSP courses.</p>
		<p>The project team of New York City public school administrators and classroom teachers will collaborate with researchers, curriculum developers, and professional learning and support specialists with the goal of improving Black and Latino/a student participation, learning, and engagement in computer science (CS). Methodologically, a Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach will be employed to address three overarching research questions:
			<ul>
				<li>What organizational conditions, processes, and supports are associated with improved participation by Black and Latino/a students in CS, as measured by the diversity of students enrolling in CS courses?</li>
				<li>What kinds of project-based instructional strategies, materials, and interventions are associated with improved student learning in UTeach CS Principles among Black and Latino/a students, as measured by student scores on projects according to standard project rubrics and unit and AP exam scores?</li>
				<li>What kinds of non-cognitive approaches (e.g., teacher messaging, classroom routines, recruitment strategies, etc.) are associated with improved engagement and motivation by Black and Latino/a students in UTeach CS Principles and retention in CS based on enrollment in following CS courses?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>This project will advance what is known about effective organizational conditions, as well as instructional interventions to promote participation, engagement, and learning across diverse groups of students, among Black and Latino/a students in particular.</p>
		<p>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</p>
		
		<h3>Education Innovation Research</h3>
		<p>EDC has received an Early-Phase Education Innovation Research (EIR) grant from the U.S. Department of Education to carry out Improving Equity in Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) Principles: Scaling Beauty and Joy of Computing. Guided by the goal to make CS education more engaging and equitable for female students, Black students, Latinx students, and students from low-income families, the project will reach an estimated 2,000 students and 100 teachers nationwide.</p>
		<p>Over the next five years, June Mark and Deborah Spencer, of EDC, and Linda Caswell, of Abt Associates, will lead a team in refining and studying the impact of the Improving Equity in AP CS Principles program. The two-year program is centered on EDC’s and the University of California, Berkeley’s (UCB) Beauty and Joy of Computing.</p>
		<p>The new EIR project builds on the successes of previous National Science Foundation-funded education R&amp;D. Over six years, EDC partnered with New York City educators and students to develop and test the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) course. Endorsed by the College Board, the course and its related professional development for teachers have been implemented in more than 100 high schools, reaching over 4,000 New York City students and 6,000 students nationwide.</p>
		<p>In the new project, EDC will work closely with partners Abt Associates and North Carolina State University to scale up the course, in collaboration with an illustrious group of key contributors: UCB, Microsoft TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools), SAP, and the College Board. Together, the team will engage in a rigorous study of implementation and impacts—the hallmarks of the EIR program—to deepen understanding of the supports needed to ensure the program improves student achievement and attainment.</p>
		<p>
			The project will feature the following three central components:
			<ul>
				<li>A school CS equity program designed to broaden participation in CS coursework by using specific strategies and resources to recruit, enroll, and retain students from groups underrepresented in CS (e.g., female students, Black students, Latinx students, students from low-income families)</li>
				<li>A teacher learning program that builds capacity for equitable and rigorous CS instruction and prepares teachers to support students’ successful completion of AP CSP</li>
				<li>An emphasis on supporting effective use of BJC, including following the AP CSP framework and BJC design principles</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>“We are delighted to be able to further strengthen and scale Beauty and Joy of Computing,” said Mark. “The EIR award will enable us to launch school-wide CS equity programs that we believe are crucial to engaging and retaining female students, Black students, Latinx students, and students from low-income families in CS education.”</p>
