		<p><a href="https://bjc.edc.org/" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Computer Science Principles" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Computer Science Principles</a> (BJC CSP) is an introductory computer science course developed by University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC). BJC CSP uses the visual programming language, <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" title="Snap! programming language" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em></a>, to offer access to rigorous programming concepts without the overhead of syntax required by a text-based language. Both BJC CSP and Snap<em>!</em> are available online for free.</p>
		<p>BJC CSP is recognized by the College Board as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for Advanced Placement® Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). Through a sequence of 8 units, the year-long course covers the 6 AP CSP Computational Thinking Practices and 5 Big Ideas with extra attention to programming including higher order functions and (in later units) recursion.</p>
		<p>BJC CSP has been developed with funding from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education and is designed for use in high school in an AP or non-AP context and offered as CS10 at UC Berkeley. </p>

		<p><a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Sparks" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Sparks</a> (BJC Sparks) is also an introductory computer science curriculum developed by the UC Berkeley and EDC that uses the visual programming language, Snap<em>!</em>. Both BJC CSP and Snap<em>!</em> are available online for free.</p>
		<p>BJC Sparks addresses the CSTA standards for middle school through 3 units that each cover a different programming style: Unit 1: Functions and Data covers the basics of functional programming through activities on string manipulation, data processing, and image manipulation. Unit 2: Sequencing and Iteration introduces imperative and event-based programming through sound and music, animation, smart systems, and data transmission. Unit 3: Physical Computing teaches physical computing using the BBC micro:bit.</p>
		<p>BJC Sparks is being developed with funding from the Hopper-Dean Foundation, is designed for use in middle school or early high school, and can serve as a complementary introduction to the BJC CSP course.</p>

		<p><a href="https://elementarymath.edc.org/k-5/" title="Think Math!" target="_blank">Think Math!</a> is a curriculum for grades K–5 that fosters children’s natural curiosity and helps them develop strong mathematical habits of mind through puzzles, investigations, and games that provide opportunities for surprise, pattern finding, and mathematical thinking.</p>
		<p><a href="https://elementarymath.edc.org/programming/" title="Math+C" target="_blank">Math+C</a> is a collection of opportunities for children to explore key mathematical content through the block-based programming language Snap!. Lessons are organized in mini-units aligned to grade-level standards, in which students build and debug their own scripts in order to solve a series of engaging mathematical puzzles.</p>
		<p>Think Math! and Math+C have been developed by EDC with funding from the National Science Foundation, and all content is available online for free.</p>
