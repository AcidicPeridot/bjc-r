			Now let's consider a slightly more complicated block that makes use of a loop.  
			It accepts two numbers as inputs (<tt>start</tt> and <tt>end</tt>) 
			and finds the sum of all of the numbers in the range from <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt>, inclusive.
        </p>

		<p>
			When <tt>start = 8</tt> and <tt>end = 10</tt>, the value reported by this function should be <tt>27</tt> (8+9+10).  
			However, the attempt at a solution shown below has some bug(s) and seems to only report 0.  See if you can fix the bug(s)
            in the code below:
