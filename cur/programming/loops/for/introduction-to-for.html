            Repeating a part of your program is a very common
            practice in programming.  We'll call this <em>looping</em>,
            and there many different blocks you can use to do it
            in many different ways.

            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png"> block is 
            appropriate if you want to repeat the same behavior for... ever.

            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png"> block is 
             great if you want to loop 
             the same behavior a certain number of times.
        </p>
            Sometimes, though, you want to do <em>almost</em> the 
            same thing for a certain number of times, but with a slight variation.  
            For instance:
        </p>
        <ul><li>You  want to draw 20 squares on the screen, but each a different size.</li>
            <li>You  want to draw 100 polygons with different numbers of sides.</li>
           <!-- any more here, yo? -->
        </ul>

<p>
            Many such situations can be handled by the <code>for</code> 
            block near the bottom of the Control palette:
