            The numbers in the <code>for</code> block work like you probably think they do: the
            inner script is run enough times to count from the left number (<code>1</code>)
            to the right
            number (<code>10</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            What's new to you here, though, is the orange oval with &quot;<code>i</code>&quot; in it.
            By using this <code>i</code>, your inner blocks can know which
            loop they are on.  Here's how:
        </p>
        <p class="quoteBlue">
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png"> block is a <em>counter</em>, and you use it in place of a number you type to stand for
            the particular loop that it taking place.
        </p>

        <p class="quoteBlue">
            Think of the <em>counter</em> like a box with a name&mdash;this one has the name <code>i</code>. This box is made for you by the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" alt="for"> block, and
            holds a different number each time through the loop.  The first time it will hold
            <code>1</code>, or whatever is the left number in the <code>for</code> block.
        </p>

        <p class="quoteBlue">
            You use it by dragging <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png">
            from the <i>source</i> within the <code>for</code> block down to the slot in
            which you will use it.
        </p>

            For instance:
