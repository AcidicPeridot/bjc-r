  <div style="text-align: left;">Now
that you have experience with some recursion, we are going to point out
some of the anatomy of a recursive procedure. The line numbers
mentioned below refer to the picture at the end of this page.<br><ul>
      <li>We always need a way to figure out that we're done and should not call the recursive call again. Lines 2-4 are the <em>Base Case,</em> in which we handle a situation so simple that we do not need to call the block recursively.</li>
      <li>If
this is not the base case we think to ourselves "Woah &#8212; That seems
complicated. I will just do a small part of the problem and delegate to
someone else". Here is what we do:<br></li>
      <ul><li>Draw the trunk of the tree (line 6), <br></li>
        <li>Position the sprite for the left sub-tree (line 7), <br></li>
        <li>Delegate to another copy of the tree block the drawing of the left sub-tree (line 8), </li>
        <li>Re-position the sprite for the right sub-tree (line 9),</li>
        <li>Delegate to another copy of the tree block the drawing of the right sub-tree (line 10),</li>
        <li>Re-position the sprite to retrace the trunk (line 11), and<br></li>
        <li>Retrace the trunk and leave the sprite exactly where it started out.
      <br>

        </li>
