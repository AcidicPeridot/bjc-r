Ross was passionate about educating women and Native Americans and spent over ten years teaching while earning her Master’s degree in mathematics during the summer.  Lockheed hired her as a mathematician in 1942.  During her thirty-plus years there, Ross contributed to cutting-edge aerospace designs including concepts for interplanetary space travel, crewed and uncrewed Earth-orbiting flights, and orbiting satellites.</p>				<p><a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/mary-g-ross-aerospace-engineer" title="Article: Aerospace Engineer, Educator, and Advocate" target="_blank">Article: Aerospace Engineer, Educator, and Advocate</a></p>			</div></body>
