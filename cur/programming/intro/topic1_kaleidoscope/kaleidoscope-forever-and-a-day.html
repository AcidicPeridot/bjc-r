       		From the previous exercise, you may have figured out
   what the <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_forever.png"
   alt="Forever Block"/> block does. The <b>forever</b> block is the
   first block you have see that holds, or wraps around, other blocks.
   We call this a <em>C block</em> because of its shape.  As the name
   <b>forever</b> implies, it will run the blocks inside it again and
   again and again and ... well, forever. You will find this block under the <b>Control</b> tab.

       	<p>
       		Will a <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_forever.png" alt="Forever
   Block"/> block ever stop?  Not unless you tell it to: Click on the stop sign icon on the upper right hand corner of the Snap<i>!</i> window.  This stop sign will stop all scripts that are running in any sprite.
