        	You may have noticed that when running the sound scripts, youâ€™d hear each sound one after another. For example, construct this script below. What is the order in which you hear the instruments?
        </p>
        <p>
        <img: sound script of trumpet, violin, guitar, piano>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		This exercise is to show you that scripts run in a specific order, from the top of the script to the bottom of the script. Your script will finish running one block before continuing on to the next one below it. Knowing this, you can plan out your scripts so that you can make something happen before the another thing happens. Keep this in mind when you make scripts in the future! It will help you understand what is going on in case something you have made is not working correctly.
