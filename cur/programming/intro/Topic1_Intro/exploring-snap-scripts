        <p>
        	Now that you have figured out how to make a sprite move, you might be wondering how to make the sprite do other things as well!
        </p>
        <p>
        	To make a sprite do more than just move, we need to use different types of blocks and link them together. You can link blocks by snapping (hence the name <em>Snap!</em>) them together -- drag a block right underneath the one to which you want to attach it. Blocks will snap together when the block’s indentation is near the tab of the one above it. You should see a white bar appear like the one in the image below, which just shows you where the block will go after you drop it.
        </p>
        <p>
        <img (---insert drag blocks snap together image---)>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		If you keep attaching blocks together in this way, you will create something that we call a script. A <em>Snap!</em> program consists of one or more of these scripts. These scripts can be long or short depending on how much you want the sprite to do.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Try recreating this in the scripting area in <em>Snap!</em>. You will find the (---insert say hello for 2 seconds block---) underneath the Looks tab.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	<img>
    		Move
    		Say “Hello” and wait 2 secs
    		Move
    		Say “You just made a script!” and wait 2 secs
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		What will happen if you run this script? Remember, a script will tell the sprite what to do. Click on the script and see what happens! You will know that your script is running if your script has a highlighted border around it after having clicked on it like in the image below.
