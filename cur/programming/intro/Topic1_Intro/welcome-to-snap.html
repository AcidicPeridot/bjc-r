   			<strong>A. Welcome to <em>Snap!</em></strong>
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			So what exactly is <em>Snap!</em>?
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			<span class="snap">snap</span> is a programming language -- a notation in which you can tell the computer what you want it to do. However, unlike most programming languages, <span class="snap">snap</span> is a visual language. Instead of writing a program using the keyboard, you will use the drag-and-drop interface in <span class="snap">snap</span> to tell the computer what to do.
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			Begin by opening <span
   class="snap">snap</span> in the browser. The url is
   http://snap.berkeley.edu/run (opens in a new tab). We recommend
   Chrome to use <span class="snap">snap</span> as it functions the
   best there, although any current browser should work too.
		</p>
		<p>
   			Now make a user account with the <span class="snap">snap</span> server. Find the cloud-shaped button in the top toolbar on the upper left corner of the window (see image below). Click it, select the "sign up" option in the menu, and follow the instructions there. You will need to check your email after creating your account to get your initial password.
