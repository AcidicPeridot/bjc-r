        	<strong>2. Experiment with Drawing Commands</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Try to get comfortable with the blocks under the Motion tab and Drawing tab. Figure out what each one does and try to use these pieces to draw a square or a simple picture. Get started by testing these blocks:
        </p>
        <p>
        	BLOCK: MOVE 10 STEPS
        </p>
        <p>
        	BLOCK: TURN RIGHT 15 DEGS
        </p>
        <p>
        	BLOCK: CLEAR
        </p>
        <p>
        	BLOCK: PEN DOWN
        </p>
        <p>
        	BLOCK: PEN UP
        </p>
        <p>
        	Tips and Tricks:
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			Once the pen is down, it stays down even in a different script. Use the “pen up” block to prevent this from happening.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			It is easiest if your sprite wears the turtle costume (the default sprite costume) so you can see the direction in which it is facing very clearly.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			You also will want to show the direction and x and y position of the sprite. In the Motion tab, you can select for these to be shown on the stage as described in the Sensor Blocks activity you saw earlier in the lab (INSERT LINK).
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Try it – Does the “turn” motion block change the x or the y position?
        		</li>
        	</ol>
