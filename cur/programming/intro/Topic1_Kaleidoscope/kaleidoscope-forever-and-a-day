       	<p>
       		From the previous exercise, you may have figured out what the (---insert image forever block---) block does. The (---insert image forever block---) block is the first block you have see that holds, or wraps around, other blocks.  We call this a “C block”.  As the name implies, it will run the block, or set of blocks, again and again and again and … well, forever. You will find this block under the Control tab.

       		INSERT SCRIPT IMAGE

       	<p>
       		Will a (---insert image forever block---) block ever stop?  Not unless you tell it to: click on the stop sign icon on the upper right hand corner of the Snap! window.  This stop sign will stop and and all blocks that are running in any sprite.
