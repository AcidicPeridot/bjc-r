    <h1>Spam vs Ham<br>
    </h1>
    A way too common problem in the world are unsolicited mails, phone
    calls, and people knocking on the front door. Nowadays, with
    electronic media, e-mails and text messages also add to the
    annoyance. Unsolicited advertising e-mails and text messages are
    very cheap to mass-distribute and therefore need only a very small
    return to be profitable.&nbsp; These unsolicited electronic massages
    have been called SPAM. For an explanation on this, refer to this
    amusing <a

    The overall problem of spam is described in detail in this <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29">Wikipedia
      article</a>. <br>
    <br>
    With spam becoming such a hard problem, many statisticians and
    machine learning people have started working on automatic
    classification problems, often labeling non-spam messages as HAM. In
    this part of the lab you will step into the shoes of a machine
    learning expert and start some inital work on automatic ham/spam
    classification on real-world text messages.<br>
