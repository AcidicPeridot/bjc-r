    <h1>Pre-Processing the Data</h1>
    In subsequent steps of this lab, we will ask you to visualize and
    work with the data in SNAP. While there is no standard solution to
    do this, we recommend you to perform two steps of what's typically
    called pre-processing:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove redundant values, i.e. get rid of information that
        doesn't make a difference.</li>
      <li>Center the coordinates so they can be visualized in an x/y
        coordinate system. Data can be easily centered by subtracting
        the mean of the data from all data points. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    While you could do this in SNAP, using a text editor and a simple
    calculator is probably an easier choice. So before you move on to
    the next step, generate a text file that contains the interesting
    part of the coordinates, centered, line-by-line.<br>
