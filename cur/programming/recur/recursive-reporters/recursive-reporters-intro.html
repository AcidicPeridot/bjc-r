			So far, all our examples of recursion have been
		    <em>command </em>blocks, whose scripts have a structure like this:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/rec-command.png" alt="recursive command pattern" />
		</p>
		<p>
			There can be any number of recursive calls interspersed with other commands in the script.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reporters are slightly trickier, because a reporter can only report <em>one </em>value. So you can't do this:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/bad-rec-reporter.png" alt="bad (multi-report) recursive reporter pattern" />
		</p>
		<p>
			(In fact, Snap<em>!</em> won't let you stack <code>report</code> blocks; since <code>report</code> ends the script, there is no connection tab below the block and you can't put anything directly below it. Optional exercise for hotshots: How did we make that picture?)
