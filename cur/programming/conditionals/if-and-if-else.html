	    Now that we have the idea of predicates under our belt, we can finally express full "if-then" statements,
	    such as "if the weather is nice, you should go outside." This can be expressed
	    in <span class='snap'>snap</span> using the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png" alt="if"/>
	    block. Notice how the first slot is shaped just like a predicate block. <code>if</code> blocks only know how
	    to handle yes/no questions, so you should only ever put predicate blocks into this slot. The C-shaped part
	    of the <code>if</code> block is where you put the commands that should be run if the condition is
	    true. Let's take a look at an example:
	</p>

	<p>
	    <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/mood.png"/>
	</p>

	<p>
	    One block you may not be familiar with is the <code>ask</code> block. It simply prompts the user with a
	    question and waits for a response. The user's response will be <em>temporarily</em> stored in
	    the <code>answer</code> variable. It's a good idea to use a more permanent variable (like <code>mood</code>
	    in the above script) to store the user's input.
	</p>

	<p>
	    In the above example, we had several possible cases to consider. However, in many situations, there are only
	    two main cases. Take for example, the following sentence: "If a number is divisible by 2, it is
	    even. Otherwise it is odd." For these situations we have the <img class="inline"
	    src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-else.png" alt="if-else"/> block. It works like this:
	</p>

	<p>
	    <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/even-odd.png"/>
	</p>

	<p>
	    Here, we didn't need to have an additional "if," because all whole numbers are either even or odd. If the
	    boolean expression (<code>x mod 2 = 0</code>) evaluates to <code>false</code>, we know that the number is not even and
	    thus must be odd.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The code we've just written could come in handy later, so let's make it into a block (if you're unsure how
	    to make a block, review the previous lab). Our block will take in a number (let's call it <code>x</code>)
	    and return whether it is even or odd (often called its "parity"). All we have to do is make a new reporter
	    block with input <code>x</code> and copy our chunk of code from above into the block definition. While we're
	    at it, let's replace the <code>say</code> blocks with <code>report</code> blocks, and remove "x is" from
	    each report (leaving just <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/report-even.png" alt="report ('even')"/>
	    or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/report-odd.png" alt="report ('odd')"/>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	    When you're finished, try writing an <code>odd?</code> block and an <code>even?</code> block. They should
	    take in a number (you can assume it'll be a whole number) and report <code>true</code>
	    or <code>false</code>. There are several ways to write these blocks. Try to write the <code>odd?</code>
	    block <em>using</em> your <code>parity</code> block and the <code>even?</code> block <em>without</em> using
	    it.
