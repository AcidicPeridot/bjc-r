	<p>
	    We now know how to write simple "if-then" statements in Snap! So far, the conditional in our uses of the
	    "if" block have been single built-in blocks (like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/equals.png"
	    alt="="/>). Let's take a look at a few more complex examples:
	</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>
		"If I am hungry and with my friends, I will order pizza."
	    </li>
	    <li>
		"If I see George and Lisa at the mall, I will say "hello" to them."
	    </li>
	    <li>
		"If we are out of milk or eggs, to the store."
	    </li>
	    <li>
		"If you are not enjoying the party, go home."
	    </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	    Discuss with your neighbor how you might express these sentences in code. In particular, think about the
	    condition part of each sentence, and what blocks you might need to write.
	</p>
	<p>
	    In past examples, we've seen conditionals that contain a single predicate (<img class="inline"
	    src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/equals.png" alt="="/>, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/less-than.png"
	    alt="<"/>, etc.). We could write a single block for each of the above conditionals, but that might be a bit
	    weird. In the first sentence, for example, this would entail writing an "am hungry and with friends?"
	    predicate. This seems a little strange because the "am hungry" and the "with my friends" parts aren't
	    necessarily related; it doesn't make sense to put them as a single predicate. So, instead, we might write
	    separate "am hungry?" and "with friends?"  predicates and combine them in some way. This brings us to three
	    special predicates: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    <Code>And</Code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> are all predicates that take in other
	    predicates. These three predicates behave in ways you might expect from their meanings in English. When will
	    the phrase "I am hungry and with my friends" evaluate to true? Only when both "I am hungry" and "I am with
	    my friends" are true. If I wasn't with my friends, the entire phrase would certainly be false. We often
	    summarize the behavior of predicates like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> using what
	    are called truth tables. Here is the truth table for <code>and</code>:
	</p>

	<table>
	    <tr>
		<th>A</th> <th>B</th> <th>A and B</th>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
	    </tr>
	</table>
