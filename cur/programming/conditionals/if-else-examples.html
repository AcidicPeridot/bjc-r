	<p>
	    Let's try making a few more blocks that use if and if-else. We're mostly going to make "reporter" blocks,
	    that actually return a value. These have rounded edges and are often called "functions."
	</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>
		Make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal.png" alt="traffic signal ()"/> block that
		when given a light color, reports the appropriate action. For example <img class="inline"
		src="/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal-green.png" alt="traffic signal ('green')"/> should report "go!"
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/letter-grade.png" alt="letter grade ()"/> block that
		takes in a percentage and reports the associated letter grade. For example, <img class="inline"
		src="/bjc-r/img/cond/letter-grade-74.png" alt="letter grade (74)"/> should report "C."
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/state-of-water.png" alt="state of water ()"/> block that
		takes in a temperature and returns whether water will be liquid, solid, or gas.
	    </li>
	</ul>
