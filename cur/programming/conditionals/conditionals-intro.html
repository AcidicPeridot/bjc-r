	    So far, you've practiced writing scripts that carry out short sequences of commands. One thing that all of
	    these scripts have in common is that they run every single one of their blocks, no matter what. But what if
	    we wanted to program a more complex application? Will we always want to run all of our code every time we run
	    the program? Let's think about a few examples:

	</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>
		Write a simple banking program that allows a user to withdraw from and deposit money into an account and
		to check their balance. At the start of the program, we will prompt the user to input what they'd like to
		do. If they choose to deposit or withdraw, we'll need to ask them how much, and then increase or decrease
		their balance accordingly. On the other hand, if they ask for their balance, we simply need to display
		it.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Create a simple number guessing game. The program will select a number in some range (say, 1-100) and
		have the user keep guessing until they guess that number. After each guess, the program should tell the
		user whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
	    </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
            Discuss with your partner about how you might write the programs mentioned above. In particular, think about
	    the individual pieces you would need to create the bigger program.
