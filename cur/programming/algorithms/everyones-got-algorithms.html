				<strong>UPS Truck Drivers</strong> have &quot;340 Methods,&quot; the UPS handbook for drivers, that describes 340 different <em>protocols</em> that should be followed and how long each one should take.

				<strong>Electricians</strong> follow the same general <em>steps</em> when replacing or adding cabling at different houses.

				<strong>Salesman</strong> often have <em>scripts</em> to follow when making a sales call.  The scripts describe how to open the conversation (and possibly more) in order to increase the odds of gaining a client.

				<strong>Subway Sandwich Artists</strong> have a <em>series of signs</em> stuck to the inside of the counter that prompt the employees with what should be said.

				<strong>Do-It-Yourself projects</strong> all come with some sort of <em>instructions</em>. <em>Directions</em>, such as those for assembling a piece of furniture or a Lego kit, are algorithms.

		Computer science <em>algorithms</em> are conceptual solutions to a problem (such as sorting a list), whereas the <em>implementation</em> of an algorithm is the actual code that brings the solution to life.  The implementations themselves can typically be written in almost any programming language and run on any computer; the concepts behind the algorithm are not affected by these types of conditions, in the same way that the outcome of a well-written recipe should (hopefully) not be affected by the cook or kitchen.
