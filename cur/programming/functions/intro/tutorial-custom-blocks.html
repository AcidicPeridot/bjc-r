		We are going to teach the computer how to draw a square using a block named <tt>draw square</tt>. Please follow the steps below:
</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Click on <tt>make a block</tt> at the bottom of the Variables palette (or right-click or control-click on the scripting area background and choose "<tt>make a block</tt>").
				<br>
				<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
					<img border="0" title="'make a block'" alt="'make a block'" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/MakeABlock-BYOB.jpg" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab04/Square/MakeABlock.jpg">
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				This will open up the <tt>Make a block</tt> dialog box. Now, you get to choose which tab the block should go into. Our block is going to draw a square, so let us choose <tt>Motion</tt>. (Note: A very common mistake is to omit this step. If you do forget, your block will become a gray Other block, in the Variables palette.)
				<br>
				<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

					<br>
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				When we selected <tt>Motion</tt>, the block became blue. We now have the option of making blocks of different shapes. Right now, however, we are  going to make a Lego-shaped command block, the default.

					<br>
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				When we click <tt>OK</tt>, we should see the block editor below. Inside the window is a picture of what your block will look like, called its <em>prototype,</em> inside a hat block. Usually a hat block is used at the top of a script to say &quot;<strong>When</strong> such-and-such event happens, run this script.&quot;  The hat block here is the same; it's saying &quot;<strong>when</strong> the <code>
					draw-square</code>
				block is run in a script, run <em>this </em>script.&quot; You'll create the script to draw a square below this hat block.

					<br>
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Use the blocks from the Control and Motion palettes to create a script that draws a square, as shown below.
				<br>
				<br>
				<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

					<br>
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				When you click <tt>OK</tt>, you should be able to use this block as if it were a regular block. Since you created the block as a <tt>Motion</tt> block, it will end up at the bottom of the <tt>Motion</tt> tab.

        </ol>
        
        
        <p>Congratulations! You have just created your first custom block.</p>
