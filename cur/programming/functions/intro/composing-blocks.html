		You can treat your custom-made blocks like any other block in snap.  
		including using them within other block definitions.

		<p>
		    Remember the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/draw-square-empty-parameter.png">
		    block?  Use it to draw the petals of a flower, like:
		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/flower-with-6-square-petals.png" alt="flower with 6 square petals">
		<p>If you look this flower, you'll see it has 6 squares drawn at equal angles around
		    a full 360-degree rotation.</p>
		    <p class="quoteOrange">
		        Create the block <br>
		        <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-square-leaved-flower-empty-paramters.png"
		        alt="block: draw square-leaved flower with [] leaves of size []">
		        <br>
                that will draw a square-leaved flower with any number of square-shaped petals with 
                the specified size.  In this block, you will rotate between calls to 
                <tt>draw square</tt> in a similar way as in the <tt>draw polygon</tt> blocks:
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/calculating-turn-angle-for-draw-flower.png"
                alt="360 divided by the number of leaves">.                
		    </p>
		    
		    An invocation of 
		<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-square-leaved-flower-6-50-parameters.png"
                alt="block: draw square-leaved flower with 6 leaves of size 50">
                should draw the example picture above.
