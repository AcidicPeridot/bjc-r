    <body>
        <p>
            You have created a block that draws a square,
            but only a square in which each side is of length
            <tt>100</tt> steps.
            It would be better if you could specify how long you wanted
            each side to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edit the block to accept an <em>input</em>
            (or<em> argument</em>),
            which tells it the length of the square it has to draw:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Right-click or control-click on the new block (either in the palette or in a script) and select <tt>edit</tt> to go back to the block editor.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    In the <tt>Block Editor</tt>, hover your cursor over the words and plus signs (<b><tt>+</tt></b>)
                    in the top block.  (This top block is called a "hat" block because of the curved top.
                    Hat blocks can never be in the middle of a script, only at the top).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking on a word will let you change that word; clicking on a <b><tt>+</tt></b>
                    will let you add something in that position.

                    We want to add an input at the end of the block, so click on the <b><tt>+</tt></b>
                    at the end.

                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    You should get the following dialog box.

                <p>
                    You have two choices about what you want to add or modify to the block definition:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <tt>Title text</tt> will let you add a regular word (or words) to the definition
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>Input name</tt> will let you add an <i>input</i>.  This is the choice we want here.

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    We want to add an input named <tt>size</tt> to our block definition.  Type "size"
                    in the input field, select <tt>Input Name</tt>, and click <tt>OK</tt>.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Your block definition has changed.  Similar to the <tt>for</tt> block, you have an special orange "box"
                    with the name that you gave it earlier.

                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="snap">snap</span> will fill the <tt>size</tt> input automatically for you whenever you use the <tt>draw square</tt>
                    block in a program.
                    In order to use the input within the <tt>draw square</tt>,

                    drag the variable <tt>size</tt> down into the move block. Whenever you need a new copy of a variable,  just drag another down.  (If you have extra copies
                    you want to get rid of, you can drag the input all the way to the palette at the left of the snap window.)

                    When you click <tt>OK</tt>, you'll see that the <tt>draw square</tt> block now takes an argument. You can put different numbers in the blank and draw squares of different sizes.
