            We are going to look more closely at the custom <tt>max</tt> block.

            Recall, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/max.png">

                predict some uses
            </li>
            <li>
                with a fellow student, describe how to fix.  What confusion 
                did Mr. Zuckerberg seem to have?
            </li>

        </ol>
