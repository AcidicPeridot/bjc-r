        <h2>Writing About Your Project</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will practice writing about your project in preparation for the AP exam.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">
			<p>The written portion of the Create task will be done after the multiple choice questions during the AP exam. You can only use your regular exam reference sheet and Personalized Project Reference sheet (Component C) during this portion of the exam.</p>
			<p>You will get four questions, one in each of these general areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>your program's design, function, and purpose</strong> - who it is for, what it does, how it works, how you made it</li>
				<li> <strong>algorithms</strong> - explaining them, describing what would happen if you changed them</li>
				<li> <strong>errors and testing</strong> - knowing what would lead to an error and how you would test for it and/or fix it (go back to page 4 Testing for helpful terms)</li>
				<li> <strong>data abstraction and procedural abstraction</strong> - understanding lists and procedures and how they manage complexity</li>
			</ul>
		
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<p>The exact questions will be different on the exam. Here are some <strong>sample</strong> prompts provided by the College Board to practice writing about your project. The four questions correspond to each of the areas above.</p>
			<ol>
                <li>Identify an expected user of your program. Describe one way your program's design meets the needs of this user.</li>
				<li>Consider the first iteration statement included in the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference. Identify the number of times the body of your iteration statement will execute. Describe a condition or error that would cause your iteration statement to not terminate and cause an infinite loop. If no such condition or error exists, explain how the loop could be modified to cause an infinite loop.</li>
				<li>Consider the procedure included in part (i) of the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference. Describe a change to your procedure that will result in a run-time error. Explain why this change will result in a run-time error.</li>
				<li>Suppose you are provided with a procedure called <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">isEqual (value1, value2)</pre></div>. The procedure returns <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">true</pre></div> if the two parameters <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">value1</pre></div> and <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">value2</pre></div> are equal in value and returns <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">false</pre></div> otherwise. Using the list you identified in the List section of your Personalized Project Reference, explain in detailed steps an algorithm that uses <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">isEqual</pre></div> to count the number of times a certain value appears in your list. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to write the program code.</li>
			</ol>
