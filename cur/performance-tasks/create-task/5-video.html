            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will reread the Create Task guidelines and develop your video.</p>

				<li>Once you have completed your program, reread the guidelines, focusing on the video and the written response. Discuss any questions you have with your classmates or teacher.</li>
                <li>If you are working on the practice Create Task, decide how you are going to create your video and learn to use the technology well enough that you are comfortable doing it along. That way, when you complete the official Create Task, you don't have to think about how to make the video; you can just focus on making it meet the guidelines. </li>

                <li>Develop your video to show what input the program takes, what it does, and what it outputs. You can't include any audio, but it will help the grader see how you've met the guidelines if you include some text.</li>
