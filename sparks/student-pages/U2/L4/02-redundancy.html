		<h2>Redundancy</h2>
		<div class="learn"></div>
		<p>An important feature of networks is <strong>redundancy</strong>: multiple paths to get to the same place. If one path is no longer available for some reason, a message can travel a different path instead.</p>
		<p>Consider roads and highways: we might always go to a destination (like a school) using a certain path. However, if one day, one of the roads is under construction, we can usually find an alternative way to get to the destination. The alternative route might be slower or more dangerous, but at least we eventually get to the destination! That's the power of redundancy.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>In your earlier experiment, you probably discovered strategies that used different paths between the same set of routers. Those different paths were redundant paths. Circle two redundant paths on your worksheet.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Break the Network</h3>
		<p>More redundancy in a network means more protection in case things go wrong in the network. This network has some redundancy, but not a lot, so there's a lot that can go wrong.</p>
		<p>Now you're going to cause some havoc!</p>
		<p>
			There are several blocks for taking down parts of the network:<br />

		<p>The cut cable blocks simulates something that actually happens a lot, cutting the cables connecting two routers. Many cables are either buried underground or lying on the seafloor, so they can easily be damaged by construction companies or ships that don't realize they're there. In 2019, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tonga-internet/severed-cable-sends-tonga-back-to-beginning-of-the-internet-idUSKCN1PI0A8" title="" target="_blank">cut cable</a> resulted in the island nation of Tonga losing it's entire Internet connection!</p>
		<p>The other blocks simulate the taking down of individual routers, not the cables between them. Natural disasters are a common cause of router loss, since routers can be destroyed or lose power. We have yet to see a router be destroyed by a T-Rex, but hey, you never know!</p>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="">
				<li>Drag some destruction blocks over to the main area and type router names in the blanks. After you take down part of the network, try sending a message again to see if it can still go through and to see whether it takes an alternate path.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="">
				<li>
					Some challenges for you:
					<ol>
						<li>There are currently multiple paths from B to D. Can you make it impossible for a message to get sent from B to D just by using a single block? Can you do it using a single <code>cut cable</code> block?</li>
						<li>Try the same from B to E. Can you block a message with a single block? What about a single <code>cut cable</code> block?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
