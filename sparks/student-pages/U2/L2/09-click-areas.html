			There are many reasons to use clicks on the stage background to run code. Clicking on part of a virtual poster might show additional information. In a game, clicking part of a map could move you there.

		</p>
		<p>
			Locations on the Snap<em>!</em> stage are described using <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates. The <em>x</em> coordinate tells you the horizontal position. The <em>y</em> coordinate tells you the vertical position. <!--The center of the stage is (0, 0). The first number in parentheses is the <em>x</em> coordinate and the second number is the <em>y</em> coordinate.  At the left edge of the stage, <em>x</em> = -240; at the right edge, <em>x</em> = 240; and the bottom and top of the stage are <em>y</em> = -180 and <em>y</em> = 180.--> <br />
		</p>
		<p>
			You can track the location of your mouse by clicking the checkbox next to the <code>x position</code> and <code>y position</code> reporters in the "Sensing" palette. Then values of those reporters will appear on the stage.<br />

		<div class="endnote">
			<p>The picture of the coordinate axes shown on the right is a Snap<em>!</em> stage background. You can add it to your project by clicking the "Stage" icon in the lower right corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window, selecting "Backgrounds..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), and selecting and importing the "XY Grid."</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> 
					Review your project plan. Where on the background would it make sense for the user to click? What will happen when they click there? 
				</li>
				<li>
					Determine the coordinates of each click area you want to create. For each click area, write down the maximum and minimum <em>x</em> and the maximum and minimum <em>y</em> coordinates. For example:<br />
					<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/click-area-chart.jpg" alt="Chart with 5 columns: Click Area, Maximum x, Minimum x, Maximum y, and Minimum y. The Click Area column includes a list of planets, and the other four columns include numbers cooresponding to the maximum and minimum x and the maximum and minimum y coordinates for each click area." title="Chart with 5 columns: Click Area, Maximum x, Minimum x, Maximum y, and Minimum y. The Click Area column includes a list of planets, and the other four columns include numbers cooresponding to the maximum and minimum x and the maximum and minimum y coordinates for each click area." />

						<h4><strong>Ways to Figure Out Snap<em>!</em> Coordinates</strong></h4>
						<ul>
							<li><em>Click the checkboxes</em> next to the <code>x position</code> and <code>y position</code> reporters the in the "Sensing" palette (shown above). </li>
							<li><em>Add the "XY Grid" stage background</em> to your project (import the "XY Grid" stage background; instructions above).</li>
							<li>
								<em>Create a script</em> that makes the sprite say the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> mouse positions.
								<div class="endnote">
									<a href="#hint-follow-script-1" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint about making the sprite say the x and y positions.">Click for a hint.</a>
									<div id="hint-follow-script-1" class="collapse">
										<p>The sprite should continuously go to the mouse position and say a list of the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> positions. <a href="#hint-follow-script-2" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of code that makes the sprite say the x and y positions.">Click for an example of this code.</a></p>
										<div id="hint-follow-script-2" class="collapse">
											<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/forever-say-position.png" alt="forever {
	go to x: (x position) y: (y position)
	say (list (mouse x) (mouse y))
}" title="forever {
	go to x: (x position) y: (y position)
	say (list (mouse x) (mouse y))
}" /><br />
											You should be able to drag this image directly into your Snap<em>!</em> project window. If that doesn't work, right-click and save/download it, and then find and drag the downloaded file into your Snap<em>!</em> project window. 
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li><em>Use more than one of these methods</em> at the same time.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="endnote">
						<h4><strong>A Helpful Tool</strong></h4>
						<p>
							If you enter the maximum and minimum <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for one of your click areas into this block and run it, it will highlight the area on the stage enclosed by those coordinates.<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/show-click-area.png" alt="show click area, x max: (200) x min: (100) y max: (0) y min: (-40)" title="show click area, x max: (200) x min: (100) y max: (0) y min: (-40)" /><br />
							To use it, drag this image into your project. If that doesn't work, download it, and drag the file into your project.

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you figured out the maximum and minimum <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coodinates for the click areas of your interactive project.</div>

		<h3>Setting Up Your Click Areas</h3>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will make things happen when the user clicks certain parts of the stage background.</div>
		<div class="vocab">
			<p>
                A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question.
            </p>
			<!--<p>
				A <strong>conditional</strong> is a block that controls the code based on a true/false condition (the predicate). The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> block is an example of a conditional.
			</p>-->
			<div class="endnote">You learned about predicates in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L6/02-l33t-text.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text" target="_blank">Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text</a>.</div>
		</div>

		<p>
			When the user clicks the stage, your program will check whether the mouse is within your click area. 
			You can use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" alt="mouse x" title="mouse x" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" alt="mouse y" title="mouse y" /> blocks in the "Sensing" palette together with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/greater-than.png" alt=">" title=">" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/less-than.png" alt="<" title="<" /> to build a <em>predicate</em> that checks. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you click the right-facing triangle in an inequality block, can can compare multiple values in the same block. <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/greater-than-arrowhead-circled.png" alt="> block with a circle around the right-facing triangle" title="> block with a circle around the right-facing triangle" />
			<span class="" style="font-size:20px;">&rightarrow;</span>
			<img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/greater-than-expanded.png" alt="() > () > ()" title="() > () > ()" /><br />
			For example, the following block checks whether :
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/example-predicate.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Build a predicate expression that reports true only when the mouse is in your click area.
					<div class="endnote">
						<a href="#hint-built-in" data-toggle="collapse" title=""></a>
						<div id="hint-built-in" class="collapse"></div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>set up "when I receive (), say (list (mouse x) (mouse y))" first</li>
				<li>Decide what you want to happen when you click each click area (play a sound-teach importing or have we in animation?, say something, do an animation or type soemthing on the stage-need to distinguish from SAY)</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="todo">
<li>
                        <strong>Sending messages:</strong> The <code>broadcast</code> block sends a message to <em>all</em> the sprites. To set the message, click the down arrow and select "new..."<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast-open.png" alt="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." title="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/broadcast-game-ready-to-start.png" alt="broadcast (game ready to start)" title="broadcast (game ready to start)" />
                        <br />
                        Once that message has been sent out, any scripts in your project that begin with the <code>when I receive</code> hat block with that same message will run: <br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/when-i-receive-showing-game-ready.png" alt="when I receive (game ready to start)" title="when I receive (game ready to start)" />
            </li>		
		</div>

	<p>Then they create and debug their on-click script</p>
		<p>hat blocks stuff comes in here</p>
		<p>test and share with a friend</p>
