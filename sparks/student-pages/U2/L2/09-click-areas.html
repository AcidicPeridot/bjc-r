		<h2>Creating Click Areas</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=pamelafox-ucb&ProjectName=BJCMS%20-%20Interactive%20Poster&editMode&noRun" target="_blank">Pamela's project</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will decide which parts of the stage background will respond to user clicks and what will happen when a user clicks them.</div>
		<p>
			There are many reasons to use clicks on specific areas of the stage background to run code. Clicking on part of a virtual poster might show information. Clicking part of a game map could move the player.

		</p>
		<p>
			Locations on the Snap<em>!</em> stage are described using <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates. The <em>x</em> coordinate tells you the horizontal position. The <em>y</em> coordinate tells you the vertical position. To define a click area, you will need two <em>x</em> coordinates (the right and left sides) and two <em>y</em> coordinates (the top and bottom).<!--The center of the stage is (0, 0). The first number in parentheses is the <em>x</em> coordinate and the second number is the <em>y</em> coordinate.  At the left edge of the stage, <em>x</em> = -240; at the right edge, <em>x</em> = 240; and the bottom and top of the stage are <em>y</em> = -180 and <em>y</em> = 180.--> <br />

					Review your project plan. Where on the background would it make sense for the user to click? What will happen when they click there? 
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="sidenote">Look below for different ways to figure out Snap<em>!</em> coordinates.</div>
					Determine the coordinates of each click area you want. For each click area, write down the maximum and minimum <em>x</em> and the maximum and minimum <em>y</em> coordinates. For example:<br />
					<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/click-area-chart.jpg" alt="Chart with 5 columns: Click Area, Maximum x, Minimum x, Maximum y, and Minimum y.

		<h3>Setting Up Your Click Areas</h3>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create an expression to check if the mouse is in your click area.</div>
		<div class="vocab">
			<p>
                A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question.
            </p>
			<div class="endnote">You learned about predicates in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L6/02-l33t-text.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text" target="_blank">Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text</a>.</div>
		</div>

		<p>
			When the user clicks the stage, your program should check if the mouse is in any of your click areas. 
			You can use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" alt="mouse x" title="mouse x" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" alt="mouse y" title="mouse y" /> blocks in the "Sensing" palette to check. <!-- together with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/greater-than.png" alt=">" title=">" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/less-than.png" alt="<" title="<" /> to build a <em>predicate</em> that checks.-->
		</p>
		<p>
			The following <em>predicate</em> expression checks if the <em>x</em> position of the mouse is between -80 and -240 and also if the the <em>y</em> position is between 180 and 60.
			that is, whether the mouse is in the yellow section of the stage shown in the picture).<br />

						<div id="hint-built-in" class="collapse">
							<p>
								You can check if your predicate is working by creating a script that makes the sprite follow your mouse around the stage and say <code>true</code> when your mouse is within the click area defined by your expression and <code>false</code> when it isn't. For example: <br />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/predicate-check-code.png" alt="forever {
	go to x: (mouse x) y: (mouse y)
	say ()
}" title="forever {
	go to x: (mouse x) y: (mouse y)
	say ()
}" /><br />
								Here's what it looks like with a predicate expression inside the <code>say</code> block:<br />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/predicate-check-code-example.png" alt="forever {

}" title="forever {

		<h3>Broadcasting a Click Message</h3>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will use messages to tell other parts of your program what to do when the user clicks your click area.</div>
		<p>
			<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/stage-icon.png" alt="screenshot of lower left corner of Snap! window showing the stage icon and two sprite icons" title="screenshot of lower left corner of Snap! window showing the stage icon and two sprite icons" />
			Since your project will react to clicks on the stage, you'll need to create code for the stage. You can find the stage scripts by clicking the "Stage" icon in the lower left corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window. (You can return to your sprite code by clicking a sprite icon.)
		</p>
		<p>The code for the stage controls only the stage (such as its background). The code for each sprite controls only that sprite (such as its costume or movement). If you want clicking the stage to make a sprite do something, then you need to make the stage talk to the sprite.</p>
		<p>
			In Snap<em>!</em>, <em>messages</em> let one part of your program talk to another part of your program. The <code>broadcast</code> block sends a message to every part of your project. You can set the message to anything that will help you remember what it means. Here's an example: <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/broadcast-game-ready-to-start.png" alt="broadcast (game ready to start)" title="broadcast (game ready to start)" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the message has been sent, any scripts in your project that begin with the <code>when I receive</code> block with that same message will run: <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/when-i-receive-showing-game-ready.png" alt="when I receive (game ready to start)" title="when I receive (game ready to start)" />
		</p>
	
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Create a script for your stage that broadcasts a message when the stage is clicked.</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					To set the message, click the down arrow and select "new..."<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast-open.png" alt="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." title="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." />
				</div>
				<li>
					Create a script that responds to that message. You'll need to decide:
					<ul>
						<li>Which sprite will respond to the message</li>
						<li>Whether the stage or the sprite will check if the mouse is in your click area</li>
						<div class="endnote">
							You could either have the stage broadcast a <em>general</em> message (such as "stage clicked") and then <em>have the sprite check</em> if where the mouse was, or you could <em>have the stage check</em> where the mouse was and then broadcast a <em>specific</em> message (such as "Jupiter clicked").
