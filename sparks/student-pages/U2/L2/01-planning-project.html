		<h2>Planning Your Interactive Project</h2>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will plan an interactive Snap<em>!</em> project and seek input from other people to improve your plan.</div>
		
		<div class="sidenote">You first learned about sprites, costumes, and the Snap<em>!</em> stage in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/03-investigating-and-storing-images.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images">Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images</a>.</div>

		<p>Your project should have characters or objects that move around (<em>sprites</em>) on top of a background image (the Snap<em>!</em> <em>stage</em>). You'll control how the sprites look by changing their <em>costumes</em>, and you'll control how the stage looks by changing its <em>background</em>. </p>
		<p>
			Here are a few of the costumes included in Snap<em>!</em>. You can also import your own.<br />

		<p>
			You're going to create an interactive project (such as a poster, a card, or a cartoon) using each of the following new skills you will build in this lab:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Costumes and Backgrounds:</strong> You can use the ones built-in to Snap<em>!</em>, import pictures from the Internet, or draw your own.</li>
				<li><strong>Animation:</strong> You'll make your sprites move around the stage, say things, and change costumes.</li>
				<li><strong>Importing Code:</strong> You'll incorporate blocks from prior projects.</li>
				<li><strong>Sounds:</strong> You'll add or create audio recordings.</li>
				<li><strong>Events:</strong> You'll make your code perform certain actions (such as playing a sound or moving) when certain things happen (such as when the user clicks a sprite or when something else has finished happening).</li>
				<li><strong>Hot Spots:</strong> You'll create special areas on the stage where the user can click to produce an specific action.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	
		<h3>Making Your Plan</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Decide on the <em>purpose</em> and <em>design</em> of your interactive project. Will it serve as a poster, a greeting card, a cartoon, or something else? Who is it for? Is it for fun or for learning? Is there a theme (holiday, sports, colors, etc.)?</li>
				<div class="todo">
				<p>Todo: add an animation of each type (poster, a greeting card, a cartoon). --MF, 3/29/22</p>
				<div class="endnote">
					<p><a href="#hint-project-examples" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for some examples of interactive projects.">Click for some examples.</a></p>
					<div id="hint-project-examples" class="collapse">
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
					</div>
				</div>
				</div>
				<li>Your project should use each of the six new skills you will learn in this lab (costumes, animation, importing code, sounds, events, and hot spots). Review what these are by looking back at the "New Snap<em>!</em> Skills" section above, and decide how your project will use each new skill you learn.</li>
				<div class="endnote">It's normal to change your plans as you start creating, but it's helpful to have a plan before you start!</div>
				<li>Draw a sketch of what your interactive project will look like.</li>
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Share the plan for your interactive project with other people and ask for their feedback. What could make the project more fun, more useful, easier to use, or more appropriate for the intended audience?
				</li>
				<li>Review the feedback you've collected and make any improvements your project plan that make sense to you.</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>Why gather feedback?</strong></h4>
					<p>Have you ever used an app or a website and thought that it was annoying or hard to use? The developers may not have had those problems when used it, but you are a different person! Designing good products requires getting input from different kinds of people to make sure that users have a good experience.</p>
				</div>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you planned your interactive project including how you will use each of the new skills you will learn in this lab, and you gathered feedback on your plan and made improvements.</div>
