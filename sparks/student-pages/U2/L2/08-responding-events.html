                    <h4><strong>Using Visible Stepping</strong></h4>
                    <p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to control how quickly Snap<em>!</em> steps through the blocks of your code. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Click the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), and adjust the slider to control the stepping speed. When you run your code, the sprite will slowly execute each step of the code and highlight it in <span style="color: black; background-color:cyan">cyan</span>.
                            <div class="endnote">
                                <a href="#hint-slider" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a video of adjusting the Visible Stepping slider.">Click for a video of adjusting the Visible Stepping slider.</a>
                                <div id="hint-slider" class="collapse">
                                    <img  class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/visible-stepping.gif" alt="Animation that shows how to use Visible stepping in Snap!" title="Animation that shows how to use Visible stepping in Snap!"/>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can slow the stepping to do only one step at a time and wait until you tell Snap<em>!</em> to go on to the next one. Move the slider all the way to the left, and then you can press the Run/Pause button (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/play-pause-button.png" alt="pause button with play/pause icon" title="pause button with play/pause icon" />) to  see what happens at each step of your code.

                                <div id="hint-slider-left" class="collapse">

                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Visible stepping can be useful as you read someone else's code because you can watch it at human speed instead of computer speed. It's also useful in debugging (fixing problems with) your own code when it's doing something wrong.</p>

            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks."  Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>
	        <p>Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>
