		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn how to make things happen when the user clicks certain parts of the stage background.</div>
		<p>
			<img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/xy-grid.png" alt="Snap! coordinate plane with labels" title="Snap! coordinate plane with labels" />
			There are many reasons to use clicks on the background to run code. Clicking on part of a virtual poster might show additional information. In a game, clicking part of a map could move you there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Locations on the Snap<em>!</em> stage are described using <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates. The <em>x</em> coordinate tells you the horizontal position. The <em>y</em> coordinate tells you the vertical position. <!--The center of the stage is (0, 0). The first number in parentheses is the <em>x</em> coordinate and the second number is the <em>y</em> coordinate.  At the left edge of the stage, <em>x</em> = -240; at the right edge, <em>x</em> = 240; and the bottom and top of the stage are <em>y</em> = -180 and <em>y</em> = 180.--> <br />
		</p>
		<p>
			You can track the location of your mouse by clicking the checkbox next to the <code>x position</code> and <code>y position</code> reporters in the "Sensing" palette. Then values of those reporters will appear on the stage.<br />

		<h3 style="clear: right;">Revisiting Your Plan and Choosing Your Click-Areas</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Review your project plan. Where on the background would it make sense for the user to click? What will happen when they click there? </li>
				<li>Click the checkboxes next to the <code>x position</code> and <code>y position</code> reporters the in the "Sensing" palette. Watch the values of the <code>x position</code> and <code>y position</code> of the mouse as you move it around the stage. </li>
				<li>For each place on the stage background that you want the user to be able to click, write down the maximum and minimum <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> values where the user will be able to click. This rectangle will be your "hot spot" (or click-area).</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
				
		<h3>Choosing Your Click-Areas</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>set up "when I receive (), say (list (mouse x) (mouse y))" first</li>
				<p>explain mouse x/y</p>
				<div class="comment">Maybe give a little worksheet for this process</div>
				<li>For each click-area that you want create, decide where it starts and ends in the x direction and where it starts and ends in the y direction</li>
				<li>Decide what you want to happen when you click each click area (play a sound-teach importing or have we in animation?, say something, do an animation or type soemthing on the stage-need to distinguish from SAY)</li>
			
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Have them create between? (<a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/2-combining-predicates.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" target="_blank">2.3.2</a>)</p>
		<p>Then they create and debug their on-click script</p>
		<p>hat blocks stuff comes in here</p>
		<p>test and share with a friend</p>
		




		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to create hot spots that use clicking differnt parts of the Snap<em>!</em> stage as events that tell the computer to do something.</div>
