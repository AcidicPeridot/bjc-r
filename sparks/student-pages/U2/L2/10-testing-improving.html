		<h2>Testing and Improving Your Interactive Project</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will investigate and improve the user experience.</div>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Do they how how to share a project yet? If so, give a link? (Do they know how to share in full-screen mode?) --MF, 1/11/23</div>
				<div class="todo">Make another little single-page worksheet for this part. "Reflect on your development process. What changes do the original design did you make as you built your project and why?" "How did people react to your final project? Did they do what you expected them to? What challenges did they face?" "What improvements will you make to your project based on watching someone use your final project and listening to their experience?</div>

				<li>Share your project with 2-3 other people, and watch them use it without giving them any hints.</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>Why can't I give the user hints about how to use my project?</strong></h4>
					<p>You probably don't know the people who developed most of the software you use. Offering users a phone number or chat service for technical support is expensive. So programmers try to make products that users can figure out on their own. Watching other people use your program without help will help you understand how easy your program is to use.</p>
				</div>
				<li>When they are finished, ask the user about their experience and how your app could be improved.</li>
				<li>Make improvements to your project. You don't have to do everything the users suggest. (Programmers often don't have time to do everything.) Focus on the biggest issue that is possible to improve first.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you observed users exploring your project (without support from you), requested additional feedback, and further improved your project.</div>
