		<h2>Testing and Improving Your Interactive Project</h2>
				<div class="todo">Make another little single-page worksheet for this part. "Reflect on your development process. What changes do the original design did you make as you built your project and why?" "How did people react to your final project? Did they do what you expected them to? What challenges did they face?" "What improvements will you make to your project based on watching someone use your final project and listening to their experience?</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will investigate and improve the user experience.</div>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>

				<li><strong>Reflect on your development process.</strong> Reread your original project plans. What changes did you make as you built it and why?</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Gather user feedback.</strong> 
					<ol>
						<li>Share your project with 2-3 other people, and watch them use it <em>without giving them any hints</em>.</li>
						<div class="endnote">
							<h4><strong>Why can't I give the user hints about how to use my project?</strong></h4>
							<p>You probably don't know the people who developed most of the software you use. Offering users a phone number or chat service for technical support is expensive. So programmers try to make products that users can figure out on their own. Watching other people use your program without help will help you understand how easy your program is to use.</p>
							<h4><strong>How do I share a Snap<em>!</em> project?</strong></h4>
							<p>Choose "Open" from the Snap! File menu (File menu button), select this project from the list, press "Share," and click "Cancel" to close the box. Then copy and share the URL (web address) out of the location bar if your browser window.</p>
						</div>
						<li>
							When they are finished reviewing your project, ask the users about their experiences and how your app could be improved. Here are some prompts to discuss:
							<ul>
								<li>Were you able to figure out how to use the project without help?</li>
								<li>Describe any difficulties you faced.</li>
								<li>Do you have any suggestions for improvement?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<strong>Describe your reflections</strong> from observing other people use your project.
					<ul>
						<li>What did you observe the users do or say?</li>
						<li>Did they do anything unexpected?</li>
						<li>What did you learn watching them use your project?</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="endnote">
						<p>For example, for a sports game project, you might write: "I saw the user get frustrated by how quickly the soccer ball faded away. I learned that my game is harder to play on a bigger screen. If I had time, I'd make it so the user can adjust the speed that the ball fades. I want to have the game suggest soccer movies, but I don't know how to find or search through movie data. Today, I'll add more costumes to the user can play with basketballs or baseballs."</p>
						<p>You don't have to do everything the users suggest. (Programmers often don't have time to do everything.)</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Document your ideas for improvement</strong> based on user-testing.
					<ul>
						<li>What would you change if you had time?</li>
						<li>Is there anything you would like to change but canâ€™t? Explain.</li>
						<li>What <em>one</em> improvement will you implement next?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Make improvements to your project. Focus on the one <em>biggest issue</em> that is also <em>possible to improve</em> first.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		


		<div class="learn">In this activity, you observed users exploring your project (without support from you), requested additional feedback, and further improved your project.</div>
