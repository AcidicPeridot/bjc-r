		<h2>Testing and Improving Your Interactive Project</h2>
		<div class="todo">Make a worksheet for this page.</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will investigate and improve the user experience.</div>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Do they how how to share a project yet? If so, give a link? (Do they know how to share in full-screen mode?) --MF, 1/11/23</div>
				<div class="todo">Make another little single-page worksheet for this part. "Reflect on your development process. What changes do the original design did you make as you built your project and why?" "How did people react to your final project? Did they do what you expected them to? What challenges did they face?" "What improvements will you make to your project based on watching someone use your final project and listening to their experience?</div>

				<li>Share your project with 2-3 other people, and watch them use it without giving them any hints.</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>Why can't I give the user hints about how to use my project?</strong></h4>
					<p>You probably don't know the people who developed most of the software you use. Offering users a phone number or chat service for technical support is expensive. So programmers try to make products that users can figure out on their own. Watching other people use your program without help will help you understand how easy your program is to use.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">You don't have to do everything the users suggest. (Programmers often don't have time to do everything.) </div>
				<li>When they are finished, ask the user about their experience and how your app could be improved.</li>
				<li>
					Write down what you saw the user do or heard they say, what you learned, what you could change if you had time, what you want to but can't change and why, and what you will change today.
					<div class="endnote">For example, for a sports game project, someone might write: "I saw the user get frustrated by how quickly the soccer ball faded away. I learned that my game is harder to play on a bigger screen. If I had time, I'd make it so the user can adjust the speed that the ball fades. I want to have the game suggest soccer movies, but I don't know how to find or search through movie data. Today, I'll add more costumes to the user can play with basketballs or baseballs."" </div>
				</li>
				<li>Make improvements to your project. Focus on the biggest issue that is possible to improve first.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you observed users exploring your project (without support from you), requested additional feedback, and further improved your project.</div>
