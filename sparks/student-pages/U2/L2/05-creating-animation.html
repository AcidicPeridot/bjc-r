								You can create animation by changing costumes. This sprite isn't moving; it just has four costumes and is changing between them using this script:<br />

	next costume
	wait (0.1) secs

							Will the sprite(s) move, change size, or turn? If they move, how will they move (instantly vs. slowly, change direction)?<br />
