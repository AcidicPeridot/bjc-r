				<p>
					A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/8-gt-7-reporting-true.png" alt="8 > 7 reporting true" title="8 > 7 reporting true" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/6-gt-7-reporting-false.png" alt="6 > 7 reporting false" title="6 > 7 reporting false" />
				</p>
				<p>
					A <strong>conditional</strong> is a block that controls the code based on a true/false condition (the predicate). The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> block is an example of a conditional.
