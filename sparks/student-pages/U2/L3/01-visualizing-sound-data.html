		<div class="todo">Need to cover 				<li><strong>2-CS-02: Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.</strong> Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing. When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.</li> very well in this lab as it's not covered elsewhere.</div>

				<p>Sound is created by pressure waves through a material (like air or water). When you hear music, an instrument or speaker (think of a vibrating guitar string, a vibrating drum head, or a vibrating speaker) creates waves of pressure that travel through the air to your eardrum, which transmits the signals through your nerves to your brain. Have you ever heard a sound that was so loud you could feel it? Those were pressure waves that were so big you could sense them with more than just your eardrum!</p>
				<p>Frequency is how often a repeating sound pressure wave repeats. Music (when its more than just precussion) is about playing different frequencies in a way that other people enjoy hearing.</p>
