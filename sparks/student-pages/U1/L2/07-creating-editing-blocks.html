		<h2>Editing the Story Structure</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll edit the structure of the story itself to make it your own story.</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Right-click the <code>super short story</code> block, and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			Just as in the <code>plural</code> block, the <code>super short story</code> hat block at the top shows you the structure of the block that will be visible from the outside, including the name of the inputs (<var>job</var>, <var>action</var>, <var>number</var>, and <var>plural animal</var>).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-block-editor1.png" alt="super short story, job: (job) action: (action) number: (number #) plural animal: (plural animal)" title="super short story, job: (job) action: (action) number: (number #) plural animal: (plural animal)" /><br />
			As before, the code inside the yellow <code>report</code> block controls what is reported when the <code>super short story</code> block is run. These inputs have already been dragged into the code for the block.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-block-editor2.png" alt="report (join ('The happy ') (job) (' sings through the parks and ') (action) (' over ') (number) (' yellow ') (plural animal))" title="report (join ('The happy ') (job) (' sings through the parks and ') (action) (' over ') (number) (' yellow ') (plural animal))" /><br />

				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss the code inside the <code>report</code> block and how it works to create the output of <code>super short story</code>.</li>
				<li>
					<div class="sidenoteBig">
						For example: 
						<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li>Story: Fifteen students are in the park.</li>
							<li>Words to vary: fifteen, students, park</li>
							<li>Variables: number, plural people, place</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					Design your super short story on paper:
					<ol>
						<li>Write out a single-sentence story.</li>
						<li>Choose 3-5 words that you want to vary.</li>
						<li>For each circled word, write the name of a <em>variable</em> (category) to describe the words that could go there.</li>

			<p>Block inputs (such as <var>job</var>, <var>action</var>, <var>number</var>, and <var>plural animal</var>) are a type of <strong>variable</strong> because the value that they provide to the <code>join</code> block <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of the <code>super short story</code> block<!-- but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code)-->.</p>
