		<h2>Editing a Block</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will customize the <code>random</code> reporter blocks.</div>
			
		<p>Some blocks are built into Snap<em>!</em> and can't be changed, but Snap<em>!</em> programmers (including you!) can also make and edit their own custom blocks. The <code>random</code> blocks in this project are custom blocks that you can edit.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>
					Choose one of the <code>random</code> blocks (<code>random job</code>, <code>random place</code>, or <code>random action</code>), right-click it (or control-click it, if you're on a Mac), and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears to open the "Block Editor."
					<div class="endnote">
						<div class="todo">NEED NEW PIC HERE</div>
						<strong>Tip:</strong>
 								<a href="#hint-edit" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an image that shows how to open the 'Block Editor.'">Click for an image that shows how to open the "Block Editor."</a>
								<div id="hint-edit" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/edit-block-in-dropdown.jpg" alt="'random feeling' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option at the very bottom of the menu highlighted" title="'random feeling' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option at the very bottom of the menu highlighted" /></div>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			In the "Block Editor," you can see that this custom block reports a random item from a list of jobs.<br />
			<div class="todo">Size of pic seems wrong.</div>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/random-job-block-editor.png" alt="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" title="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>
					Change some of the items in the list for the block you are editing. (That is, change some of the colors to other colors, some of the jobs to other jobs, or some of the places to other places, etc.)
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also <em>add</em> more items to the list or reduce the number of items in the list by clicking the arrows at the end of the list block (&#9668; &#9658;).</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					When you are finished editing, click the "OK" button, and click the block that you edited several times to make sure that it reports a random item from the list you edited.
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> If it doesn't work right, edit the block again and also edit another one of the <code>random</code> blocks at the same time. Compare the code for your edited <code>random</code> block that isn't working with the <code>random</code> block that is working.</div>
				</li>
				<li>Once you have a working revision to a <code>random</code> block, try it out in your <code>Super Short Story</code> block.</li>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>Edit a few other <code>random</code> blocks to customize the story further.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
