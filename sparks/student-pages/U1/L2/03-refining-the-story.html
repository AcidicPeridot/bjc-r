		<h2>Refining the Story</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>There were a lot of fill-in-the-blank prompts in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12GtjpO8cawrWDrR-qTwy4kRTn3M4kF6WW-hW_x7JWtk/edit" title="Activity 2: Refining the Story Google Doc" target="_blank">Refining the Story Google Doc</a>. How are we going to handle that for the HTML version? --MF, 8/11/21<br />Any ideas, anyone? --MF, 8/20/21</p>
			<p>Next revision: this page should be split into at least three shorter pages, and the vocab box about abstraction should be cut down considerably. --MF, 2/9/22</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll use operator functions to generate random numbers and to join letters together to make new words to improve the story.</div>

		<h3>Using a Random Number</h3>
		<p>
			Notice that the input slot for numbers is a different shape. In Snap<em>!</em>, the shape of an input slot tells you what kind of input you can put in that slot. A rectangle will accept any kind of text (letters, numbers, punctuation, emojis, etc.), but an oval will only accept a number. <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" />
		</p>
		
		<p>You've used special <code>random</code> blocks that were designed especially for this project to generate random feelings, jobs, actions, places, etc. Programming languages (including Snap<em>!</em>) have a built-in way to generate random numbers.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Locate <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10-full-size.png" alt="pick random (1) to (10)" title="pick random (1) to (10)" /> in the palette on the left hand side of the Snap<em>!</em> window, drag it into the Scripts area, and click it a few times.
				<div class="todo">They could just click on the block in the palette without dragging it out; is there a reason not to teach that? -bh</div>
				</li>
				<li>Change the inputs to <code>pick random number</code> a few times, and each time you do, click it a few times to see what happens.
				<div class="todo">Do you want to specify whole number inputs?  (Or, alternatively, suggest they also try decimal-fraction inputs?) -bh</div>
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Describe what the <code>pick random number</code> block does.</li>
				<li>
					Drag <code>pick random number</code> into the number input slot of <code>Super Short Story</code>, and run that block a few times to verify that a random number is used in the story. If it isn't working right, work with another student to sort out the problem.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-pick-random.png" alt="'super story story' block with 'pick random (3) to (12)' in the 'number' input slot" title="'super story story' block with 'pick random (3) to (12)' in the 'number' input slot" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Editing the Inputs with <code>Join</code></h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>If you haven't used the <code>random animal</code> block, try it in the animal input slot of the <code>Super Short Story</code> block now. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" /> What is a potential problem with using this block in this story?<div class="todo"><p>The talk thing is awkwardly large and affects the line height funnily, maybe just the short icon? -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean by a "short icon" but here are some thoughts... --MF, 8/20/21<ol><li>We could redesign the icons; the originals are in /bjc-r/img/icons/icons.ai. Any changes will to the existing PNG will impact CSP. I think that's OK, but it's worth noting.</li><li>We could use class="imageRight" instead of "inline" but I do like using the icon as part of the text...</li></ol></p></div></li>
				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Find the <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join()().png" alt="join" title="join" /> block in the palette and drag it into the Scripts area. Click it, change the inputs, and click it again. What does the <code>join</code> block do?</li>
				<li>
					Drag the <code>random animal</code> block into the first slot of the <code>join</code> block and type an "s" in the second slot. Click it to test that it reports a plural animal, and then drag the entire <code>join</code> expression into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)" />
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>
				<li>Share your project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), selecting this project from the list, pressing "Share," and clicking "Cancel". Then copy the URL (web address) out of the location bar at the top of the window, and send it to your friends, family, and/or teacher.</li>
