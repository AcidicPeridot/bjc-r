        <title>HOFs with Recursion: Introduction</title>

        <p>
            HOFs and recursion are two of the most important programming techniques that we have learned.
            One limitation in our use of recursion so far has been that each recursive function can only make a set
            number of recursive calls. As we will see in today's lab, we can make recursive functions more general using
            HOFs. This will allow us to make arbitrary numbers of recursive calls. As a result, we can carry out operations
            on structures more complicated that the factorials or the fibonacci numbers.
