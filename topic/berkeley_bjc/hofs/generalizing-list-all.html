        <p>
            A few pages ago, we wrote the blocks
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <img src="list-all-pandigital.png" alt="list all pandigital numbers between min and max"/>
            <img src="list-all-factorions.png" alt="list all factorions between min and max"/> <br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The functionality of these blocks (and, probably, your implementations of them) bear a striking resemblance to one another.
            Computer scientists love generalization, so let's make a block that can accomplish the duties of both
            of the above blocks. Since the main difference between the two is what predicate they use, we'll add that as in input.
            Hint: when writing the block below, <code>call</code> will be quite useful.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <img src="list-all-numbers-with-property.png" alt="list all numbers with property between min and max"/> <br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Once you've written this block, try running it like this:
        </p>   
         
        <p>
            <img src="list-all-numbers-with-property-pandigital.png" alt="list all numbers with property pandigital between min and max"/> <br/>
            <br/> <img src="list-all-numbers-with-property-factorion.png" alt="list all numbers with property factorion etween min and max"/> <br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Does the output match the "list all" blocks from earlier?
