title: Recursion with Trees and Fractals
{
h2: Big Ideas
big-idea: Understand the techniques to solving a computer science problem recursively.
big-idea: See examples of recursion in nature and art and its relationship to how we already conceptualize various aspects of our world.

//	video: Recursion I [https://coursesharing.org/courses/6/lectures/17]
	video: No new lectures; prepare for midterm Wednesday.
	reading: Blown to Bits, Chapter 5 [http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter5.pdf]

h2: Activities

learning-goal: Explore the idea of representing a problem in terms of itself.
learning-goal: Practice planning and coding recursive blocks.

h2: Reminder
big-idea: Make sure you watch the first recursion lecture before doing this lab!
